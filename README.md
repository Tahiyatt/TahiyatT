# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tahiyat

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Stony Brook University, passionate about using technologyâ€”especially AI and machine learningâ€”to drive meaningful change. With 3+ years of hands-on coding experience, I'm focused on building solutions that address real-world challenges, particularly around climate change and sustainability.

Raised in NYC, I grew up surrounded by diversity and innovation, which shaped my curiosity and drive to create impact through tech. Whether it's working with real-world datasets or building projects from scratch, Iâ€™m always eager to explore how code can solve important problems.

Outside of coding, I love hiking, exploring new places, and connecting with people who care about building a more inclusive and sustainable future through technology.
